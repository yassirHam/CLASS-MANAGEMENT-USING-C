Salle Management Project in C 🚀

The Salle Management Project is a console-based application developed in C to manage the reservation of salles (halls or venues) for both students 🎓 and administrators 🖥️. The project is designed with two distinct user spaces: one for students and another for administrators. Each space has specific functionalities and access levels, ensuring a secure and organized system for managing reservations. 🔒✨
